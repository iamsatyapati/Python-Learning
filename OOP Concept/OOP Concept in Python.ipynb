    "# OOP Concept in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What is OOP\n",
    "\n",
    "In procedural programming we code as sequence of steps. Procedural programming is great for data analysis and scripting.\n",
    "In Object Oriented concept code as interactions of object. It is great for buidling frameworks and tools. It make the code more organizable and maintainable. The OOP concept is about objects and classes. Class is a blueprint on which a object is created. Classes has logical existence. Object is the instance of the class, it has physical existence. An object incorporate about state and behaviour. For example if a customer is a object then state(attribute) might be phone number and email id and behaviour(methods) might be place order or cancel order.\n",
    "\n",
    "The state and behaviour bundled together in a class, the tendency is called **Encapsulation**. Classes defines the possible states and behaviours that the object of the class can have. In python everything is a object and every object has a class. The class can be founded by type method. State and behaviours are contained in attribute and methods respectively. \n",
    "\n",
    "Creating a class:\n",
    " \n",
    "             class ClassName:\n",
    "             # we can create empty class with pass statement after class name. And object of the empty class can be\n",
    "                 created\n",
    "                 \n",
    "                 # pass \n",
    "                 \n",
    "                 # method is a function within the class with 'self' as it's first argument.\n",
    "                 \n",
    "                 def doSomething(self):\n",
    "                     pass\n",
    "                    \n",
    "A attribute can be accessed by objectname.attribute and a method can also be accessed with obj.method(\\*args). Self represents the particular object. It stands for the object referred in a class defination to access that objects properties. obj.method() is equivalent to pass the object to the method. Attributes are variables assigned with objects. \n",
    "\n",
    "Constructor allows the object to take variables while created. In python the constructor name must be \\_\\_init\\_\\_(), it takes all variabes and assign it to the object while created. It is called automatically, everytime an object is created. We can also set default values. Avoid to create attributes outside the constructor. \n",
    "\n",
    "Make your class name in CamelCase. Method names should be separated by \\_ and should be all small, better to be verb. Use docstring both in classes and also in methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Instance label data vs Class label data **\n",
    "\n",
    "Instance attributes are for the objects. It is stored in instance variables, which is initiated in \\_\\_inti\\_\\_() method.\n",
    "\n",
    "Class attributes are outside of the \\_\\_init\\_\\_ method. Which is common for all instances. Class attribute is like a global variable of the class. It is accesible with class names like : classname.Variable . It is more likely to be a global constant for the class. Methods are shared among instances. We also can also define a class label method, but it can't access the instance label data. To define a class method we have to start with class method decorator (@classmethod). The first argument is not self, but cls. To call a class method classname.method(\\*arg). As there are only one constructor. The class method can also be used to create objects os the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "        @classmethod\n",
    "        def classmethodname(cls,file):\n",
    "            return cls(file)\n",
    "            \n",
    "obj = classname.classmethodname(\\*arg)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Inheritance**\n",
    "\n",
    "It is fundamentally important for code reuse. Class inheritance is about to inheriting a parent class and adding some modifications to it. \n",
    "\n",
    "            class Child(Parent):\n",
    "                pass\n",
    "                \n",
    "Child class can use all attributes and methods from parent class. isinstance(child) should return Parent. Inheritance shows 'is a' relationship. We can add attributes, methods and constructor to a child class. We can run the constructor from the parent class by calling 'Parent.\\_\\_init\\_\\_()'. This should be defined inside child class init method. Also pass self to both the constructors. Then we can add more functionality. We can call the parent constructor, but we don't have to. We can use methods from child as well as parent class in the child class instances. Inside childs methods we can also call the parent class methods. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Operator Overloading**\n",
    "\n",
    "Even if all attributes are same, then obj1 == obj2 will return False. Thats because of both the objects stored in different locations. We compare references while comparaing 2 objects. But thats not the case in numpy array or pandas dataframe. \n",
    "\n",
    "While comparing 2 objects under the scene \\_\\_eq\\_\\_() method is called. it should accept 2 argument, self and other and compare the attribute like self.attr == other.attr. It must return an boolean. However python allows us to overload all the comparing operator (ge, gt, lt, le, ne, eq). Python can implicitly call eq for ne, if ne is not available.\n",
    "\n",
    "\\_\\_hash\\_\\_() is allowed the object to be hashable, means can be key of the dictionary. \n",
    "\n",
    "- If parent and child compared. Python always called the **Child class eq method**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Operator Overloading: str, repr**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Str is for end user and more formal. Implicitly it calls the repr method. It is string representation.\n",
    "- repr on the otherhand is for developers. It is reproducable representations for strings. It is used for fallback of print, when str is not defined. \n",
    "\n",
    "- str method accept only self as argument and return a string. Use .format to format the string. \n",
    "- repr also accepts self and return a string. make sure repr is reproducable like class('name', age) not class(name,age). obj will call repr implicitly.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Polymorphism**\n",
    "\n",
    "Using a unified interface to operate on objects of different classes. This has to be true syntatically and semantically. \n",
    "Syntactically: function signatures are compatible like arguments and returns.\n",
    "Semantically : The state of the object and program remains consistent. Like subclass methods doesn't strengthen input condition. Subclass method doesn't weaken output condition. And no output condition. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Managin data access**\n",
    "\n",
    "All data in python are public by default. Because python philosophy is we all are adult here. We can restrict access by naming convention, using @property decorator or by modifying \\_\\_getattr\\_\\_() and \\_\\_setattr\\_\\_(). \n",
    "\n",
    "- In naming convention we use a single \\_ to make the attribute privete. like \\_attribute. It can be accessible publicly, but the developer try to mark this as a private attribute. As a class developer, use it for implementation details, helper function. \n",
    "- If an attribute start with \\_\\_ then this is private. Python does name mangling means the \\_\\_attr is treated same as \\_attr. But a \\_\\_ says that it is not inherited. These are pseudo private attribute. It is used to prevent names in inherited classes. \n",
    "- Leading and trailing underscores are for inbuilt methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Properties**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use a @property decorator on a method whose name is exactly the name of the restricted attribute, returns the restricted attribute.\n",
    "- Use a @attr.setter on method attr that will be called on obj.attr = value. The value to assign is passed through argument. We can handle for the given attribute like checking for negative value and raising an error.\n",
    "- Like for a employee class the salary is the restricted attribute. The salary method is with @property method return the salary. The method same salary method with @salary.setter will assign a new value to salary. \n",
    "- When we assign like obj.attr, then the setter method will be called by default.\n",
    "- If you don't add a @attr.setter, the property will be read only like: df.shape\n",
    "- Add @attr.getter when the property value is retrived.\n",
    "- Add @attr.deleter when the property is deleted using del.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Liskov substitution principle** states that base class should be interchangeable with any of its subclasses without altering any properties of the program. "
