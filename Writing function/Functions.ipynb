It is written in 1st line of the function. Some popular formats of the doc string are: Google style, numpy doc, re structured text, epy text. \n",
    "\n",
    "In google style, 1st line is what does the function do in imperative style, like: split the datadrame and extract the columns; but not this function split the data frame then extract the columns. You can mention the arg is optional or not.\n",

    "## Principles\n",
    "- DRY: (Don't repeat yourself) Instead of copy paste the same set of code in multiple places, we can write functions to do the same. \n",
    "- DOT: (Do one thing) Every function should have a single responsibility.\n",
    "- Advantages : More flexible, easy to understand, simpler to test, simpler to debug, easier to change. \n",

    "## Properties\n",
