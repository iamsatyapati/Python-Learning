    "## Doc String\n",
    "It is the first step of your documentation. The doc string should contain the what it does, the parameters, the returns, possible error occured, possible extra note you want to mention. It is written in 1st line of the function. Some popular formats of the doc string are: Google style, numpy doc, re structured text, epy text. \n",
    "\n",
    "In google style, 1st line is what does the function do in imperative style, like: split the datadrame and extract the columns; but not this function split the data frame then extract the columns. You can mention the arg is optional or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "        decription of the function\n",
    "        \n",
    "        Args:\n",
    "            arg1 (data type): description of arg 1 and split to next line if needed.\n",

    "        \n",
    "In numpy doc the headings like Args, Returns, Raises are underlined by using(-) dash. The function doc string can be accessed by using func_name.\\_\\_doc\\_\\_. By using inspect module, inspect.getdoc(func_name) we can also get the documents in a better way. \n",

    "## Principles\n",
    "- DRY: (Don't repeat yourself) Instead of copy paste the same set of code in multiple places, we can write functions to do the same. \n",
    "- DOT: (Do one thing) Every function should have a single responsibility.\n",
    "- Advantages : More flexible, easy to understand, simpler to test, simpler to debug, easier to change. \n",
    "\n",
    "code smells and refactoring ????\n",
    "\n",
    "## Properties\n",
    "- Pass by assignment: list can be changed like:\n",
    "\n",
    "        def change(x):\n",
    "            x[0] = 99\n",
    "        \n",

    "        change(my_list) # [99,2,3]\n",

    "        # another example\n",
    "        def bar(x):\n",
    "            x += 4\n",
    "        val = 7\n",
    "        bar(val) # 7 ; no change\n",
    "        \n",
    "        # mutable values can be changes as reference given to them, immutable can't be changed they are used real value\n",
    "        \n",
    "Mutable: list, dict, set, bytearray, objects, functions, almost else <br>\n",
    "immutable: int, float, bool, string, bytes, tuple, frozenset, None<br>\n",

    "        argument is already modified and contain the first list. So instead pass none as default and change it inside\n",
    "        the function then return it like:\n",

    "## Context Managers\n",
    "A context manager is a type of function which used to set up the context, runs your code and remove the context. For eg: \n",
    "\n",
    "        with <context_manager>(arg) as <variable>:\n",

    "            \n",
    "### We can also create our own context manager\n",
    "We can create our own context manager by using 2 methods: class based, function based. Creating a function based context manager as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "        @contextlib.contextmanager\n",
    "        def my_context(*args):\n",
    "            # your code\n",
    "            # yield statement\n",
    "            # optional code to clean context : like; db.disconnect() - tear down code.\n",
    "            \n",
    "- With statement can be nested."
